These are notes from the lua programming course.

When you start a new game with love, always define three fundamental functions: 
- Load
- Update
- Draw

Load: this function is called once at the beginning of the game. It's where you load your assets, initialize variables, and set up the game state.

Update: defines the game loop. This function is called every frame, and it's where we will update the game state, check for collisions, and handle user input.

Draw: this function is called every frame after the update function. It's where we will render the game objects to the screen.
